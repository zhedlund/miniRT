This code defines a simple ray tracer in C, which renders a scene containing a sphere and a plane. Here's a breakdown of the key components:

### Struct Definitions:
- `vec3`: Represents a 3D vector with x, y, and z coordinates.
- `point3`: Alias for `vec3`, used for clarity.
- `color`: Represents an RGB color with red, green, and blue components.
- `ray`: Represents a ray with an origin point and a direction vector.
- `camera`: Contains parameters related to the camera such as focal length, field of view (fov), viewport dimensions, and orientation vectors.
- `ambient`: Defines ambient lighting properties including ambient color and intensity.
- `light`: Represents a light source with direction, intensity, and color properties.
- `lighting`: Combines ambient and directional light properties.
- `sphere`: Describes a sphere with center, radius, and color.
- `plane`: Defines a plane with a point and normal vector, along with a color.

### Functions:
- `dot`: Calculates the dot product between two vectors.
- `vec3_length_squared`: Computes the squared length of a vector.
- `write_color`: Writes a color value to the image buffer.
- `hit_plane`: Determines the intersection of a ray with a plane.
- `hit_sphere`: Determines the intersection of a ray with a sphere.
- `add_color`: Adds two colors component-wise.
- `vec3_unit_vector`: Normalizes a vector.
- `ray_color`: Calculates the color of a pixel based on ray intersections with objects in the scene.

### Main Function:
- Initializes variables for the camera, sphere, plane, ambient light, directional light, and image dimensions.
- Sets up the rendering environment using the mlx library
- Iterates over each pixel in the image, constructs rays from the camera origin through each pixel, and calculates the color of each pixel using `ray_color`.
- Renders the image on a window using the mlx library.

This code forms a basic ray tracer capable of rendering simple scenes with spheres and planes, incorporating ambient and directional lighting.
